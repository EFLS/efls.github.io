      <title>Sensitizing for Algorithms: Foregrounding Experience in the Interpretive Study of Algorithmic Regimes</title>
      <link>https://www.eliasstorms.net/publication/storms-2024/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigations of algorithmic regimes benefit from attention to
people&amp;rsquo;s experiences. However, when applying methods that involve
users and lay people to this topic, particular challenges arise:
unequal and low awareness of algorithmic systems, digital
inequalities, varied meanings of &amp;ldquo;algorithm,&amp;rdquo; and the fact that people
are often not involved as users in such systems. We propose
&amp;ldquo;sensitizing activities&amp;rdquo; as a technique to address these challenges:
preparatory exercises that subtly foreground the presence of
algorithms, thus raising algorithmic awareness and establishing a
shared understanding among participants without distorting their
experiences and expectations. Drawing on our experience with
sensitizing activities in three studies, we provide suggestions to
researchers and practitioners who want to deploy this technique in
their own investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#39;Transparency is Meant for Control&#39; and Vice Versa: Learning from Co-designing and Evaluating Algorithmic News Recommenders</title>
      <link>https://www.eliasstorms.net/publication/storms-2022b/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Publication for CSCW 2022&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algorithmic systems that recommend content often lack transparency
about how they come to their suggestions. One area in which
recommender systems are increasingly prevalent is online news
distribution. In this paper, we explore how a lack of transparency of
(news) recommenders can be tackled by involving users in the design of
interface elements. In the context of automated decision-making,
legislative frameworks such as the GDPR in Europe introduce a specific
conception of transparency, granting &amp;lsquo;data subjects&amp;rsquo; specific rights
and imposing obligations on service providers. An important related
question is how people using personalized recommender systems relate
to the issue of transparency, not as legal data subjects but as users.
This paper builds upon a two-phase study on how users conceive of
transparency and related issues in the context of algorithmic news
recommenders. We organized co-design workshops to elicit participants&amp;rsquo;
&amp;lsquo;algorithmic imaginaries&amp;rsquo; and invited them to ideate interface
elements for increased transparency. This revealed the importance of
combining legible transparency features with features that increase
user control. We then conducted a qualitative evaluation of mock-up
prototypes to investigate users&amp;rsquo; preferences and concerns when dealing
with design features to increase transparency and control. Our
investigation illustrates how users&amp;rsquo; expectations and impressions of
news recommenders are closely related to their news reading practices.
On a broader level, we show how transparency and control are
conceptually intertwined. Transparency without control leaves users
frustrated. Conversely, without a basic level of transparency into how
a system works, users remain unsure of the impact of controls.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Foregrounding Algorithms: Preparing Users for Co-design with Sensitizing Activities</title>
      <link>https://www.eliasstorms.net/publication/alvarado-2020/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Paper presented at the NordiCHI 2020 conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algorithms are present in many of our everyday activities.
However, there is generally low awareness of their presence among users, and there are various conceptualizations to define them.
Additionally, algorithms are often both complex and opaque.
These characteristics raise challenges when applying co-design activities to the interaction design of algorithms.
We argue that researchers can overcome these challenges by developing sensitizing activities: activities that foreground the presence of algorithms, thus raising algorithmic awareness and a shared understanding, without influencing their initial experiences and expectations.
We share how we applied sensitizing activities in two case studies: sensitizing interviews, and diary studies together with two-phase workshops.
We share our experiences applying these techniques to overcome the challenges of low algorithmic awareness and multiple algorithmic understandings of participants.
Finally, we offer recommendations for researchers and practitioners when applying sensitizing activities in this design context and invite further methodological discussion on this challenging topic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exploring Actor-Network Theory in the Investigation of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://www.eliasstorms.net/publication/storms-2019b/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Paper accepted for the workshop
&lt;a href=&#34;https://authentic.sice.indiana.edu/philosophy-hci-workshop/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: Exploring the Intersection of Philosophy and HCI&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;
at the CHI 2019 conference in Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This draft connects &lt;em&gt;Actor-Network Theory&lt;/em&gt; and Human-Computer Interaction, reflecting on ongoing research on algorithmic ranking and selection.
It is very much a &lt;em&gt;working paper&lt;/em&gt;, and even though work on it has stalled, I am still interested in turning it into a full article at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This short paper, a submission for the HCI workshop &amp;lsquo;Standing on the Shoulders of Giants&amp;rsquo;, looks at scholarly studies of the presence of algorithmic selection in everyday life and how existing research benefits from and is connected to Actor-Network Theory (ANT). The paper then suggests that the empirical and philosophical strengths of ANT could benefit not just algorithms, but the broader field of HCI. With this exercise, this submission touches upon multiple key topics of the workshop. Most prominently, the paper addresses topics 2 and 6 by suggesting how ANT could connect to existing debates on, for example, &amp;lsquo;post-userism&amp;rsquo;. Also topic 5 is relevant, since the rather obscure philosophical underpinnings of ANT need to be made more accessible if we hope to make its approach useful for HCI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time regimes in debt collection and mediation</title>
      <link>https://www.eliasstorms.net/publication/storms-2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.eliasstorms.net/publication/storms-2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The full article is included in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eliasstorms.net/schuld-in-meervoud&#34;&gt;doctoral dissertation.&lt;/a&gt;
While the other parts are in Dutch, you can read the original article in chapter 11 in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eliasstorms.net/schuld-in-meervoud/storms-2020-schuld-in-meervoud.pdf&#34;&gt;the PDF version.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt and time are inherently linked. In its essence, a debt is a quantified promise to pay at some point in the future. This article explores the temporal dimension of debt that manifests itself during the process of debt collection, the phase at which indebtedness becomes most tangible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on in-depth interviews and ethnographic fieldwork in the world of debt collection in Flanders, Belgium, we analyse how different temporal techniques used by &amp;lsquo;street-level&amp;rsquo; debt collectors incite debtors to pay. Both in collection out of court by collection agencies as well as in judicial enforcement of the obligation to pay, debt collection imposes a strict schedule of repayment on the defaulting debtor. In this &amp;rsquo;time regime&amp;rsquo; imposed upon debtors, payments are closely tracked, so that any deviation can be met by swift reminders and pecuniary punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time regimes of debt collection can conflict with the temporal structures present in the everyday economic lives of the debtors. Incongruences appear due to frictions between the rhythm of repayment on the one hand, and temporal irregularities of the economic lives of debtors on the other. To further explore this time dimension, we also look at how debtors respond and adapt to the new temporal impositions, and how debt mediators deploy temporal strategies when assisting the over-indebted. By negotiating payment plans with creditors, debt mediators mitigate the harsher aspects of the time regime enacted through collection agencies and judicial officers.&lt;/p&gt;
